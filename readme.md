# Real-time Chat Application

In this project, I created a real-time chat application where users can check each other's online/offline status and send images. The project utilizes various technologies including **Axios**, **TailwindCSS**, **Zustand**, **Socket.io**, **Cloudinary**, and **MongoDB**.

## Features

- Real-time messaging using Socket.io
- User's online/offline status tracking
- Ability to send and receive images
- Customizable themes in the settings

Below are the screenshots of the application, displayed in a 2x3 grid:
